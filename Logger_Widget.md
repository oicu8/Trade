### Logger Widget

![logger_widget](https://img3.picload.org/image/rwilgcwr/neutron_logger_widget.png)

* Reads *.Neutron/debug.log* contents in real-time
* Web-Search via Context-Menu (duckduckgo & google)

**Warning:** Date & Time fields in the logger table show weird values, because the entries in *debug.log* of Neutron don't contain date/time stamps. A few additional changes in the original logging procedure are needed to produce 'correct' values for the logger table.
